            <p class="lead">Jonathan Lashgari has been passionate about programming since he got his first computer at 7 years of age.</p>
            <p> To him, programming is about expressing your ideas through a medium that allows the creator to provide useful and engaging experiences to a wide audience of users. He also realizes the importance of collaboration in the computer programming field and loves to make sure everyone is being heard and will seek feedback from others.</p>
            <p>At Wheeler Magnet High School, Jonathan participates in the robotics club, CircuitRunners as a programmer. Since his sophomore year, he has been the programming lead for the GRITS and FRC teams and in his senior year, he has become the Head of Programming for the entire club. Throughout his time at the club, he has collaborated with the entire team, across different disciplines, to create programming for a robot, to ensure that everyone is satisfied with the robotâ€™s function, all the while he teaches and leads aspiring programmers in the club. Aside from competition teams, Jonathan has also volunteered at outreach events to encourage and promote programming at a young age.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, Jonathan likes to expand upon his passion for programming through contests and programming projects. He loves the freedom and sense of community these open source projects give. He is currently the project manager of Glowstone, a popular open source server software. He has also developed websites for various companies, through a continuous feedback loop to ensure their satisfaction with the design and function of the website. Additionally, Jonathan has created a Java API/networking system for the popular team chat website Slack. Finally, he has participated in many computer game creation contests, as they give him an exciting platform to freely create and express himself. One example of such contest is Mozilla GameOn, which he got Notable Runner-up for in 2013.</p>
